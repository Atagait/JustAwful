# JustAwful
Really, just terrible.
----------
JustAwful is a C# implementation of "A memory intensive game of try and catch."
- Basic types should only be used for temporary holding
- Functions should always return void
- Values returned from functions should always be thrown as exceptions
- Ideally, value-holding objects are destroyed when their values are accessed
